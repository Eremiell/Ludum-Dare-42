# Ludum-Dare-42

This is my ludum dare 42 game, otherwise known as "Astronauts with Flamethrowers". 
It was made using an engine that I made in 3 days known as the LDEngine.
The most noteable features in the engine are: 
hardware-accelerated path-traced light baking with bvh generation. 
reflection-probe rendering and loading using cubemaparrays. (supports potentially hundreds of reflection probes)
